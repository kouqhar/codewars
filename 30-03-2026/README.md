## Truncate the Text 2

Given a string, return a new string that is truncated so that the total width of the characters does not exceed 50 units.

Each character has a specific width:

| "Letters"                  | "Width" |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| "ilI"                      | "1"     |
| "fjrt"                     | "2"     |
| "abcdeghkmnopqrstuvwxyzJL" | "3"     |
| "ABCDEFGHKMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"  | "4"     |

> The table above includes all upper and lower case letters. Additionally:

- Spaces (" ") have a width of 2

- Periods (".") have a width of 1

- If the given string is 50 units or less, return the string as-is, otherwise

- Truncate the string and add three periods at the end ("...") so it's total width, including the three periods, is as close as possible to 50 units without going over.
