## Are they the "same"

Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Examples

Valid arrays

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]

b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]

comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]

b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]

Invalid arrays

If, for example, we change the first number to something else, comp is not returning true anymore:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]

b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]

comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]

b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]

comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.

Remarks

a or b might be [] or {} (all languages except R, Shell).

a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in C++, COBOL, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, F#, Haskell, Nim, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PowerShell, Prolog, PureScript, R, Racket, Rust, Shell, Swift).

If a or b are nil (or null or None, depending on the language), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.

## Detect Pangram

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Replace With Alphabet Position

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example

Input = "The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."

Output = "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"

## Who likes it?

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[] --> "no one likes this"

["Peter"] --> "Peter likes this"

["Jacob", "Alex"] --> "Jacob and Alex like this"

["Max", "John", "Mark"] --> "Max, John and Mark like this"

["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] --> "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

## Counting Duplicates

Count the number of Duplicates

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Example

"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once

"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'

"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)

"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times

"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice

"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'

"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice
