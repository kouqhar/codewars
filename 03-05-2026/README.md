## String Math

Given a string with numbers and other characters, perform math on the numbers based on the count of non-digit characters between the numbers.

If the count of characters separating two numbers is even, use addition.

If it's odd, use subtraction.

Consecutive digits form a single number.

Operations are applied left to right.

Ignore leading and trailing characters that aren't digits.

For example, given "3ab10c8", return 5. Add 3 and 10 to get 13 because there's an even number of characters between them. Then subtract 8 from 13 because there's an odd number of characters between the result and 8.
