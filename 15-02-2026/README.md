## 2026 Winter Games Day 9: Skeleton

Given a string representing the curves on a skeleton track, determine the difficulty of the track.

The given string will only consist of the letters:

"L" for a left turn

"R" for a right turn

"S" for a straight segment

Each direction change adds 15 points (an "L" followed by an "R" or vice versa).

All other curves add 5 points each (all other "L" or "R" characters).

Straight segments add 0 points.

The difficulty of the track is based on the total score. Return:

"Easy" if the total is 0 - 100

"Medium" if the total is 101-200

"Hard" if the total is over 200
