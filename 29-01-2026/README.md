## Build Tower

Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "\*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

[
" * ",
" *** ",
"*****"
]
And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

[
" * ",
" *** ",
" ***** ",
" ******* ",
" ********* ",
"***********"
]
