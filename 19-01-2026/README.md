## Find The Singleton

A class of students have a project to work on in pairs. Everyone in the class found a partner, apart from one student. Using the student_list provided (which details every student in the class represented by the number of their team), find the student with no partner.

Note :

The number of teams can represent either: only two students or the single student. Try to find the most efficient solution!

INPUT

Number [] ===> student_list

^^ this contains students represented by their team number

OUTPUT

Number single_student_number

CONSTRAINTS
2 <= student_list[i] <= 100000

3 <= i <= 10000

EXAMPLE

Input : ===> [2,4,5,4,2]

Output : ===> 5

## Lucky number

Write a function to find if a number is lucky or not. If the sum of all digits is 0 or multiple of 9 then the number is lucky.

1892376 => 1+8+9+2+3+7+6 = 36. 36 is divisible by 9, hence number is lucky.

Function will return true for lucky numbers and false for others.

## Vowel Remover

Create a function called shortcut to remove the lowercase vowels (a, e, i, o, u ) in a given string.

Examples

- "hello" --> "hll"
- "codewars" --> "cdwrs"
- "goodbye" --> "gdby"
- "HELLO" --> "HELLO"

don't worry about uppercase vowels

y is not considered a vowel for this kata
