## Find The Singleton

A class of students have a project to work on in pairs. Everyone in the class found a partner, apart from one student. Using the student_list provided (which details every student in the class represented by the number of their team), find the student with no partner.

Note :

The number of teams can represent either: only two students or the single student. Try to find the most efficient solution!

OUTPUT

CONSTRAINTS
2 <= student_list[i] <= 100000
