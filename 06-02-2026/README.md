## Vowel Count

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

## Descending Order

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:

Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

## Ones and Zeros

Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:

Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1

Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2

Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5

Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9

Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2

Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6

Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15

Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11

However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
