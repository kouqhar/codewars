## Browser History

Given an array of browser commands, return an array with two values: the history as an array of URLs, and the index of the current page.

Valid commands are:

"URL" - Where URL is a web address ("freecodecamp.org" for example).
 Navigates to the given URL, adds it to the history at the next position, and discards any forward history.

"Back" - moves to the previous page in history, or stays on the current page if there isn't one.

"Forward" - moves to the next page in history, or stays on the current page if there isn't one.

For example, given ["freecodecamp.org", "freecodecamp.org/learn", "Back"], return [["freecodecamp.org", "freecodecamp.org/learn"], 0].
